# REVIEWING GAMES
Once you've made an account, on the homepage, you should see a library of games that you can search through. (If you do not see a game you'd like to review on the homepage, you may click the +NEW REVIEW button on the website header, and use the search bar on the review form.) Clicking on one of these games should bring you to it's page, where you can hit the +NEW REVIEW button under the game's cover image to leave a review on that game. You may edit and delete your reviews by visiting the game's page again.
